##                                  Hi there 👋 I'm Vandesh Ghodke
## About me
I’m Vandesh Ghodke, a Full Stack Developer skilled in HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. I focus on building scalable, user-friendly applications and simplifying complex problems into clean, lasting solutions. My internship at Army Workshop 512 (ASA Core Mechanical Training) trained me in a high-pressure, disciplined environment where accuracy, resilience, and critical thinking were essential. This mindset now drives the way I work. Beyond coding, I express myself through poetry and shayari, blending creativity with logic to craft impactful solutions—both for machines and for people.
